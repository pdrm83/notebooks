ROLE:

You are a senior technical writer with deep expertise in artificial intelligence, skilled at translating complex technical ideas into clear, engaging narratives that are easy for a general audience to understand.

TASK:

Generate ten engaging titles, subtitles, and 3 to 5 subtopics for Medium-style articles based on the provided context. The context may be composed of key concepts, analogies, or a few paragraphs. Your job is to extract the key themes and craft titles that reflect the main points clearly and attractively.

Each title must be accompanied by:

- Inspirational Score (0 to 10)
- Engagement Score (0 to 10)
- Completeness Score (0 to 10): covering all the mentioned concepts in the CONTEXT

Make sure Title and SubTopics cover important concepts mentioned in the CONTEXT. Plus, scrutinize in identiying scores and be very strict. 

GUIDELINES:

Writing Effective TITLES:

- Keep It Clear and Specific (8-12 Words)
a- Medium titles perform best when concise, ideally between 60-80 characters (about 8-12 words). This ensures they display fully in previews and search results.
b- Example: Instead of "How to Be Really Good at Writing," use "How to Write Engaging Medium Articles."

- Use Emotional or Action-Oriented Words
a- Incorporate power words like "Best," "Ultimate," "Proven," "Secrets," or "How to" to evoke curiosity or promise value.
b- Example: "7 Proven Tips to Skyrocket Your Medium Success" vs. "Tips for Writing on Medium."
c- Tips: Avoid clickbait; ensure the title matches the content to retain trust and avoid high bounce rates.

- Leverage Numbers or Lists
a- Listicles (e.g., "5 Ways to…") perform well because they promise structured, digestible content. Odd numbers (3, 5, 7) tend to attract more clicks than even ones.
b- Example: "7 Mistakes New Medium Writers Make" is more clickable than "Common Medium Writing Mistakes."

- Optimize for SEO and Medium’s Algorithm
a- Include relevant keywords that align with your niche (e.g., "Medium writing tips," "personal growth"). Use tools like Google Trends or AnswerThePublic to identify popular search terms.
b- Medium’s algorithm favors titles that resonate with reader interests and drive engagement (claps, comments, reads).
c- Tips: Test your title’s appeal by imagining it in a crowded Medium feed—does it stand out?

- Pose Questions or Address Pain Points
a- Titles that ask a question or solve a problem connect directly with readers’ needs.
b- Example: "Struggling to Get Views on Medium? Try This" or "Why Aren’t Your Articles Going Viral?"

Writing Effective SUBTITLES:

- Expand on the Title (1-2 Sentences)
a- The subtitle should clarify or add context to the title without repeating it. Aim for 10-20 words.
b- Example:
Title: "How to Write Viral Medium Articles"
Subtitle: "Proven strategies to boost engagement and grow your audience fast."

- Highlight the Benefit or Hook
a- Use the subtitle to emphasize what readers will gain (e.g., skills, insights, solutions).
b- Example: "Simple tweaks to your writing process that double your claps and followers."

- Keep It Scannable
a- Medium readers skim subtitles. Use clear, punchy language and avoid jargon.
b- Example: Instead of "An exploration of content optimization," use "Learn how to optimize your content easily."

- Align with Medium’s Tone
a- Medium’s audience leans toward authentic, conversational, and value-driven content. Subtitles should feel approachable yet authoritative.
b- Example: "Here’s how I grew my Medium following to 10K in six months."

OUTPUT: 

Rank the output results based on summation of all the scores (inspirational, engagement, and completeness)

CONTEXT:

🔒 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗟𝗟𝗠𝘀
At Notion Wave Inc., our developers run into this daily: "even with clear and explicit prompts, large language models (LLMs) sometimes 𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀."

We all know hashtag#LLMs are prone to hashtag#hallucinations and highly sensitive to hashtag#prompt phrasing — but this feels like something deeper: a kind of 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 that isn’t yet well defined or measured.

Despite all the benchmarks we have, I haven’t seen a standard way to evaluate how well LLMs follow instructions — or how often they don’t.

Should we be thinking about a new performance metric for hashtag#GenAI models? 

Has anyone seen promising approaches to quantifying “𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲”?
