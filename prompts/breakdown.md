Goal:

To help viewers learn prompt engineering step by step, understand why each refinement matters, and see how a vague prompt can turn into a highly specific, professional-grade one.

Context: I want to create a video demonstrating how prompts can significantly improve over time by applying the right principles and prompt engineering guidelines. I already have the final, optimized version of the prompt.

Task: I need a breakdown of the final prompt into several progressive stages, starting from a basic, minimal prompt and gradually evolving it to the advanced version. Use as many steps as needed

Output: For each stage, Iâ€™d like to highlight:

The prompt version (as it would look at that stage)

The principle or improvement added (e.g., role assignment, structured output, expert context)

The reason why that change makes the prompt better

Create an .md file that contains the whole answer.

Final Prompt:
